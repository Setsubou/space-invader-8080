# Space-Invaders-Emulator
A 1978 Space Invader Emulator I've created around two years ago when I started learning Programming.
The emulator is a buggy, slow mess that only managed to play the game's Demo mode.
I might revisit and rework this Emulator sometime in the future when I have more free time, otherwise this will stay like this for now.
