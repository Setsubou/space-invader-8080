# Space-Invaders-Emulator
A 1978 Space Invader Emulator I've created somewhere around 2019 when I started learning Programming.
The emulator is a buggy, slow mess that only managed to play the game's Demo mode.

This emulator is now in archive mode, it'd be probably be better for me to restart this emulator from scratch if I ever feel like continuing this emulator.
As for now though, this code is provided as is.
